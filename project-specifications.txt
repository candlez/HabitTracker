What is the high level purpose of this program?
 - To keep track of habits and progression towards goals

What features might that entail?
 - Daily habit tracking
    - With a way to determine which days habits are tracked
 - Habit completion visualization
 - Long-term goal tracking
    - With progress bars
 - Ways to track metrics (like weight, time spent working on coding projects)

That is all data that needs to be stored somewhere!
 - So there will need to be a way to write and read from a database.

How should the data be formated in the database?
 - Each day gets a report card?
 - I think just one line in the database per day, with a row for each thing being tracked

Different High-level Components:
 - A "form" for tracking habits with a submit button (should remember which have already been completed for the day)
 - "Check-ins" for various metrics being tracked
    - These should go away for the day after being filled-in 
 - A place to view the historical data in a visually interesting way
 - A place to display progress for the day
 - A page to edit which habits and metrics are being tracked
